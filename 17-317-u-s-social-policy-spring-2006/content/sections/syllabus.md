Course Overview
---------------

This class is divided into four sections, each of which is illustrated with case studies of various social programs. We open by discussing cultural and institutional reasons for American exceptionalism in social policy, using the case of health insurance. In the second part of the class, we begin studying policy inputs with a focus on the mass public: defining political participation, studying subgroup differences in participation rates, exploring the origins of political preferences, examining patterns of interest group organization, and discussing the nature of representative government and the theoretical relationship between participation and representation. In the third part of the course we turn to the policymaking process, studying how problems come onto the political agenda and how Congress, the courts, and the bureaucracy shape policy. Fourth, we study policy in practice: how policies are implemented; how their designs shape client experiences and subsequent policy outcomes; where we draw the line between public and private provision; and with a few final case studies how the working years, gender, and human capital formation (education) are treated by U.S. social policy. We conclude by speculating about the likely course of American social policy in the future.

Grading
-------

Grades will be earned on the following basis:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Class Participation | 20% |
| Intermediate Projects (Assignments 1-4) | 20% |
| Final Paper | 60% 

  

Students are expected to complete the intermediate projects, each of which is a stage in preparing the final research paper. For the research paper, students will choose a policy area and examine the course of policymaking - what factors led to the policy outcome that was achieved? The final paper (20-25 pages, double-spaced, 12-point type) is due 2 days after Lec #25 at 5:00 pm at my office. Students will also take turns writing discussion questions and helping to lead class discussion (3-4 times during the semester, depending on enrollment). These efforts will be part of the seminar participation grade. The discussion questions should be emailed to the class by 5:00 pm the evening before your assigned day.
